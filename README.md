# Headless Filmmaking
**Tools** to work with video/audio using headless tools like ffmpeg.  These all work, but far from robust.  

***IN DEVELOPMENT!*** Using ffmpeg builds from [Gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)

o. Fast conversion of media files

o. Capture a portion of the screen and use some tricks to make it a transparent webm video that can be used as graphics later on.

Big thanks for inspiration from [FFMPEG GUY](https://www.youtube.com/@theFFMPEGguy). @maclev on the AHK forum solved a very difficult problem I came up against in the ffmpeg webcam capture script.
