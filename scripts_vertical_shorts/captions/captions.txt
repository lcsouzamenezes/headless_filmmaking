Russia invading Ukraine, shelling, torturing, raping and killing
West says, we’ll give you some weapons, hopefully enough
Not, for certain, all you’d need
Okay, you’ve had a year, let’s negotiate
Ukraine to West,
What part of torturing, raping and killing don’t you get
Time to fight dirty.  
West, you’re with us or against us, sorry, no, not sorry.
You, Mr. America, always talk tough about  'consequences'
But it’s you who are next in line for consequences.
