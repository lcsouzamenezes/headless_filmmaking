Brexit and Putin Process

1. In OBS I record some ad-hoc ranting
2. then I wrote a script with what worked
3. Set up script to record/edit on telepromper setup
4. pull WAV file using shutter
5. Have Azure create captions file (can prob get Premiere to do it too).
6. Create Pr project, using 1080x1920 PNG background to create short format sequence
7. Drag my video rant onto it.  Place above
8. Fix audio so peaks near -6 db (multiband compressor, broadcase preset, might improve, but didn't use it here)
9. Pull SRT file into Pr.
10. Double click on one to open SRT edit pane on left
11. Select all captions (shift key) so I can change format of all
12. Watch video and edit each caption so the words come at best time (also, need to fix spelling or where I need commas, etc).
13. In export, make sure "captions" is set to "burn in"
